## 💡 The Story Behind This

Traditional portfolios are boring. Résumés blend together. I wanted to create something that would:
1. **Stand out** from the crowd
2. **Showcase technical skills** in action
3. **Be fun** and memorable
4. **Demonstrate creativity** in problem-solving

So I built a memory game where the real prize is discovering a developer who thinks differently.
